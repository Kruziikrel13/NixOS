My laptop for university and work when away from home.

Single drive. No dual boot. Uses btrfs everywhere.

### Specifications

| **RAM** | 16GB |
| **CPU** | AMD Ryzen 7 5700U @ 1.80 GHz |

### Notes
- Runs out of battery quite fast.
- Has a very slow base clock rate. Needs to be overclocked for larger tasks.
